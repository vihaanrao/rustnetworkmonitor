## Project Intro
Our MVP is a Rust-based ray tracer. It is designed to render 3D scenes with realistic lighting and reflections. The main goals and objectives of our project are:

- Implement a basic ray tracer that can render spheres and diffuse lighting.
- Add more features such as shadows, reflections, and refraction.
- Optimize the ray tracer for performance.
- Display the output in a window or save it to a file.
- Utilize Rust's modern features such as traits and macros to improve code quality and maintainability.

We chose to work on this project because we believe that building a ray tracer from scratch is a challenging and rewarding task that can help us improve our Rust programming skills.

## Technical overview
Our Rust ray tracer is composed of the following major components:

- Scene module: This module defines the 3D scene to be rendered, including the camera, objects, and lighting.
- Ray module: This module defines the ray tracing algorithm and handles intersections between rays and objects in the scene.
- Output module: This module handles the output of the rendered image, either by displaying it in a window or saving it to a file.
- Optimization module: This module optimizes the ray tracer for performance, using techniques such as multithreading and spatial data structures.

## Checkpoints
### Checkpoint 1:

- Implement the basic ray tracer that can render spheres and diffuse lighting.
- Display the output in a window or save it to a file.

### Checkpoint 2:

- Add more features such as shadows, reflections, and refraction.
- Optimize the ray tracer for performance using multithreading.

### Checkpoint 3:

- Refactor code to improve readability and maintainability.
- Add more advanced features such as texture mapping and anti-aliasing.
- Experiment with different rendering techniques such as path tracing.
